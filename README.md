This repository contains the implementation of HGCC based on RecBole, which is mainly in the `extra` folder. The article is in submission and we will post the full version upon acceptance.

## Environment:
The code was developed and tested on the [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) v1.0.1.
